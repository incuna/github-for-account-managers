# The GitHub Interface

GitHub has a fair number of buttons on it, and this section is a quick reference to help you navigate your way around.

This is the home page of our example repository:

The page breaks down into five main areas:

1. __File display.__ This is the area that lists all the files in (the currently-selected branch of) the repository.  The drop-down above that says `branch: master` allows you to switch between branches in view, and defaults to `master`. Clicking on the files allows you to view the code within.
2. __Management toolbar.__ This area at the top allows you to see commits that have been made to the repository, branches on the repository, public releases that have been made, and contributors, people who have committed to or commented  on the repository.
3. __Issue navigation.__ This sidebar is the most useful section for you. You can navigate to the lists of open issues and pull requests, and each repository has an attached wiki where contributors can add pages of useful information - specifications or documentation, for instance.
4. __Readme display.__ This area shows the contents of the `README.md` file in the repository. This file contains useful introductory information for anyone looking to make use of the code.
5. __User toolbar.__ This toolbar has a search box, links to your profile and settings, and a small notification button (directly under the number label) that turns blue when you have unread notifications.

## The GitHub Notifier

[The GitHub Notifier](https://github.com/sindresorhus/GitHub-Notifier) is a great browser plugin that causes an icon to show up on the toolbar in your browser, displaying how many unread GitHub notifications you currently have. Clicking it takes you to the GitHub notification page.

The Notifier is an extremely handy tool, and lets you easily keep on top of incoming notifications, keeping you in touch with your teammates. To install it, click on the link appropriate to your browser on the page linked above, and follow the instructions there.
