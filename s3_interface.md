## The GitHub Notifier

[The GitHub Notifier](https://github.com/sindresorhus/GitHub-Notifier) is a great browser plugin that causes an icon to show up on the toolbar in your browser, displaying how many unread GitHub notifications you currently have. Clicking it takes you to the GitHub notification page.

The Notifier is an extremely handy tool, and lets you easily keep on top of incoming notifications, keeping you in touch with your teammates. To install it, click on the link appropriate to your browser on the page linked above, and follow the instructions there.
