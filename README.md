## About this guide

If you're an account manager working at a software agency, you'll have heard of GitHub. Of course you have, you're reading this. Chances are that at some point, you've also caught some flak from your development team for using GitHub wrongly. _And that's okay._

This aim of this guide is to show you how to use GitHub the way your developers do, to get the most out of your development team &ndash; and ultimately, keep your clients happy.
