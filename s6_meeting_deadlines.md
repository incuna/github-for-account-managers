# Meeting a client deadline

In the last section, we looked at how to identify a problem &ndash; like a bug, or a client-requested change &ndash; and describe it to a developer so they can fix it.

But like the proverbial buses, client amends rarely come alone. To group multiple issues together and give them a deadline, we can use GitHub's __milestones__.

## Hitting a deadline

In traditional project management, a milestone marks the end of a package of work, or the end of a project phase.<sup>1</sup> The end of work might coincide with shipping or deploying a project, or there might be a period in between to allow for testing.

In GitHub terms, a milestone is a container for issues, with a due date attached to it. Issues are assigned to a milestone, and as they are closed, the milestone's progress moves toward 100%. When the miletstone hits 100%, it can be closed. And that's as complicated as it gets.

> An issue without a milestone has no urgency. If you need an issue closed by a certain date, __it has to be part of a milestone__.
