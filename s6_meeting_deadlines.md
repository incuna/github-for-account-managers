# Meeting a Deadline

Once we've created our issues we have a couple of ways to refine the content when working on projects. This can be of benefit to both you and the developer(s) working on the project as it allows you to see a concise overview of a specific 'milestone' or 'label' (we'll review this both separately later). By doing this you can improve your own workflow and the workflow of the developer(s) working on the project with you.

These systems can both be added, removed and altered without affecting the original content.

## Milestones

Milestones are pretty much what it says on the tin. They're a way to set a goal/target to keep all members of the repository on the same timeline. Every account manager and developer has varying ways of using them but I'm going to outline the way in which I find the to be best used.

The first is setting overarching goals. We do this because it allows us to have specific milestones to hit at each phase of a projects development. An example would be based on a project with a timeline delivery date of 14th July. This date will be set as a milestone labled 'Final Deadline' in this instance.

We can also use milestones to create separated 'mini' goals such as the development of an Android build of the app that has a different due date but uses the same API or framework.

When we need to be more precise about situations or specifics related to individual issues we can refer to 'labels'.

## Labels

Using labels allow us to be more specific about the issue we've created and create an 'at a glance' overview. An example would be if we are expecting artwork from a creative agency. Seeing as we are expecting it, there is no harm in adding an issue into GitHub while it's all fresh in your mind but in this case we aren't able to supply the actual artwork. 

In order to make this clear to the development team, all we would need to do is add a label that says 'awaiting agency' or something to that effect. If there isn't already a label then you can create your own easily but try to restrict yourself to just using them when it's necessary. Not everthing needs a label!

As you can see, these are both simple and effective tools for ensuring that both the account manager and the developer(s) involved understand what goals are in place and the specifics of each issue at a glance.With these tools in place we can all work faster and more efficiently on each project.
