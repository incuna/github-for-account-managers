# 6. Meeting a Deadline

In the last section, we looked at how to identify a problem &ndash; like a bug, or a client-requested change &ndash; and describe it to a developer so they can fix it. 

But like the proverbial buses, issues rarely come alone. Fortunately, we also have a couple of ways to group them, using __milestones__ and __labels__. These groupings can be added, removed and edited without affecting the original issues.

This section is all about hitting deadlines, so we'll look at milestones here, and labels [in the next section.](https://github.com/rogerhutchings/github-for-account-managers/blob/markdown/s7_labelling_issues.md)

## Milestones

Milestones keep contributors to a repository working on the same timeline. 

In GitHub terms, a milestone is a container for issues, with a due date attached to it. Issues are assigned to a milestone, and as they are closed, the milestone's progress moves toward 100%. When the milestone hits 100%, it can be closed. And that's as complicated as it gets.

Depending on the project, milestones can correspond to different goals. Those might be major project phases, for example; equally, they can be used for smaller goals, like features or different platform builds using the same codebase.

What milestones should all have in common, however, is a due date.

> An issue without a milestone has no urgency. If you need an issue closed by a certain date, __it has to be part of a milestone__.

### Creating a new milestone

1. On the issues screen, click the `Milestones` tab at the top left of the pane.
2. If you have no open milestones, you can create on by clicking the link in the middle. Otherwise, click the `Create a new milestone` button on the left.

3. Add in a name and description, __and a due date__, and click `Create milestone`!

### Adding an issue to a milestone

1. Back in the issue list, check an issue, and click on the `Milestone` drop-down above the issue list.

2. And that's it! You can also add an issue to a milestone from the issue's own page, by clicking on the `Milestone` section of the right-hand bar.

### Viewing the issues in a milestone

You can filter out issues that aren't in your milestone.

1. In the issues list, click on the gear drop-down in the `Milestone` area in the left-hand bar, and choose your milestone.

We've looked at using milestones to help developers hit client deadlines, but what if we want to group issues by type, rather than date? GitHub's got you covered there too, using __labels__.
