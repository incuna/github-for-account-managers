# 7. Labels

Using labels allow us to be more specific about the issue we've created and create an 'at a glance' overview. An example would be if we are expecting artwork from a creative agency. Seeing as we are expecting it, there is no harm in adding an issue into GitHub while it's all fresh in your mind but in this case we aren't able to supply the actual artwork. 

In order to make this clear to the development team, all we would need to do is add a label that says 'awaiting agency' or something to that effect. If there isn't already a label then you can create your own easily but try to restrict yourself to just using them when it's necessary. Not everthing needs a label!

As you can see, these are both simple and effective tools for ensuring that both the account manager and the developer(s) involved understand what goals are in place and the specifics of each issue at a glance.With these tools in place we can all work faster and more efficiently on each project.
