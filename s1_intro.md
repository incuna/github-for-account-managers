# Introduction

The idea for this guide has been brewing for a while. 

All of us work at a software agency, where we use GitHub for version control. If you haven't tried it yourself, the nature of agency work means lots of rounds of changes in a relatively short time. But all too often, we saw GitHub issues like this:

> The latest set of client amends are in a PDF on the file server. How long's that going to take?

There's three problems here:

1. We don't know how many problems there are and what type, because all that information is locked away in a PDF.
2. We can't split up the work between us, because there's no way of finding out who's working on what short of yelling at each other.
3. We don't know the deadline, so we can't schedule in the time.

But instead of nagging our Accounts team on points of GitHub etiquette - because no-one likes that guy/girl, let's be honest - we decided to try and explain _why_ we do things the way we do, and present that knowledge in a way that enables accounts teams to do their jobs effectively by helping developers to do theirs.

But to do that, we're going to have to talk a bit about some of the basic ideas behind version control first...
